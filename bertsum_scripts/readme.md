## Running BERTSum

These scripts should be copied into the `src` directory of the repository [here](https://github.com/nlpyang/PreSumm). Also, these scripts require access to the modified datasets we use (`easy-ans-samples-cnndm.pkl` and `hard-ans-samples-cnnd.pkl`.)

- `get_samples_bertsum.py`: formats the summary-article pairs in the modified dataset so othat they can be fed to the BERTSum model in the repository. Output text files will be saved in directories as specified in the script.
- `run_bertsum.sh`: script that executes commands for running BERTSum on the output text files generated by `get_samples_bertsum.py`. Note that the outputs will be saved in the `results` directory of the repository.
- `merge-candidates.py`: retrieves the outputs from BERTSum, collects the selected sentences and merges them in to a single text file for reference.
